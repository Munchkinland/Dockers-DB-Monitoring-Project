# Docker Compose Setup for Data Management and Monitoring
## Project Description

This project sets up a comprehensive development environment using Docker Compose, integrating multiple services essential for data management, visualization, and monitoring. The environment includes:

âœ…PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system for storing and managing data.
âœ…Portainer: A user-friendly graphical interface for managing Docker containers, allowing you to monitor and control your containers and images.
âœ…Grafana: A versatile platform for creating, sharing, and visualizing metrics and data through dashboards and graphs.
âœ…Metabase: A tool for exploring and analyzing data with ease, and generating reports.
âœ…Prometheus: A robust monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for collecting and storing metrics, particularly from containerized applications.
âœ…Node Exporter: A Prometheus exporter that collects system-level metrics, such as CPU and memory usage, from the host system.
âœ…pgAdmin: A graphical interface for managing PostgreSQL databases, simplifying tasks such as database creation, management, and query execution.

This setup helps in monitoring and managing the health and performance of your applications and infrastructure, ensuring data is well-organized and insights are easily accessible.

## Importance of Monitoring

Effective monitoring is crucial in modern development and operations for several reasons:

âœ…Performance Optimization: Monitoring allows you to track the performance of your applications and systems, helping to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.
âœ…Early Issue Detection: By continuously observing system metrics, you can detect and address issues before they escalate into serious problems.
âœ…Reliability and Stability: Monitoring helps ensure that your systems remain reliable and stable, reducing downtime and improving overall system health.
âœ…Data-Driven Decisions: With access to accurate and timely data, you can make informed decisions to enhance system performance and efficiency.
âœ…Compliance and Auditing: Monitoring provides a record of system activity, which is useful for compliance and auditing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running this Docker Compose setup, ensure you have the following installed:

âœ…Docker Desktop: Docker Desktop is necessary to manage Docker containers on your local machine. It provides the Docker engine, Docker CLI, and Docker Compose. Download and install Docker âœ…Desktop from the official Docker website.
âœ…Docker Compose: Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop, so installing Docker Desktop will also install Docker Compose. It allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
ðŸ¤”requirements.txt: For the services defined in this docker-compose.yml, you don't need a requirements.txt file as it is used for Python projects to list dependencies. However, if you were to list the Docker images and their versions used in the project, it would look something like this:


postgres:latest
portainer/portainer-ce:latest
grafana/grafana:latest
metabase/metabase:latest
prom/prometheus:latest
prom/node-exporter:latest
dpage/pgadmin4:latest

This file is not strictly necessary for this Docker Compose setup but might be useful if you want to keep track of the versions of the Docker images used.

## Steps:
âœ…Create docker_compose as required
âœ… Start the environment:

# Commands
docker-compose up -d

âœ…If you want to stop the environment:

docker-compose down

Access Services:

âœ…PostgreSQL: Port 5432
âœ…Portainer: http://localhost:9000
âœ…Grafana: http://localhost:3000
âœ…Metabase: http://localhost:3001
âœ…Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
âœ…Node Exporter: http://localhost:9100
âœ…pgAdmin: http://localhost:8080

## Notes

âœ…Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine before running these commands.
âœ… Please run first Docker Desktop, otherwise it doesnÂ´t works.
âœ…Adjust environment variables and volume paths as needed for your specific setup.
âœ…Feel free to modify this configuration to better fit your needs or to include additional services!

Enjoy Monitoring! ðŸ˜Š
